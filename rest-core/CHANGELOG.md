# Changelog

#### 0.36.0.4

* Drop (internal) dependency on either, this removes 20(!) transitive
  dependecies.

#### 0.36.0.3

* Allow `either 4.4.*`

#### 0.36.0.2

* Allow `aeson 0.9.*`

#### 0.36.0.1

* Allow `errors 2.0.*`

## 0.36

* File output now needs a third component, specifying if the file is
  served as 'attachment' or not. If so, this will make most browsers
  download the file instead of displaying it. This is a breaking
  change. You can add a third element `False` to the return value to
  get the old behaviour.

* Re-exported XML serializable types from `rest-types` no longer have
  `regular` `PF` instances since they are now using GHC Generics.

#### 0.35.1

* Remove unneeded constraint from `domainReason`.

## 0.35

* Change input/output dictionaries to indicate separately if there are
  dictionaries, and for what type. This is a breaking change. The most
  likely problems are where `Reason ()` is explicitly used in handlers
  without error dictionaries. Simply replace these with `Reason_`.
  Additionally, all `some*` combinators are deprecated now. They are
  just the identity function and can be removed.

* The types of all dictionary combinators have changed, the Dicts
  type, the dicts smart constructor, empty, SomeError, Modifier, many
  internal (but exported) things in Rest.Driver.Perform, some types in
  Rest.Handler, and Void was moved.

* Switched all usages of `ErrorT` to `ExceptT`. To stay backwards
  compatible with older versions of `transformers` and `mtl` you can
  use the `transformers-compat` and `mtl-compat` packages. To update
  your code: `s/ErrorT/ExceptT` and
  `s/Control.Monad.Error/Control.Monad.Except/`.

* Add `>|<` to `Rest.Error`. It combines two `ExceptT` computations
  yielding the last error if both fail. This is a replacement for
  using `<|>` with `ErrorT` since the `Alternative ExceptT` instance
  needs a `Monoid` instance for the error.

* Fix typos in haddock for `Param` dictionary.

* Switch to explicit export lists where missing.

#### 0.34.0.3

* Allow `aeson-utils 0.3.*`

#### 0.34.0.2

* Allow utf8-string 1.

#### 0.34.0.1

* Fix for base 4.8/GHC 7.10.

## 0.34

* Allow setting the method in the requests in a top level multi
  handler.
* The `getMethod` `Rest` class function now returns a `Maybe`.
* The `route` method in `Rest.Driver.Routing` now takes a `Maybe
  Method`.
* The `Method` type was removed from `Rest.Driver.Types` and moved to
  rest-types' `Rest.Types.Method`.

#### 0.33.2

* Allow top level multi handler as a POST as well as a GET.
  Technically, you're not allowed to vary the response based on the
  body of a GET. Also, in some frameworks (e.g. jQuery) it isn't
  possible to set the body of a GET.

#### 0.33.1.2

* Typo fixes in documentation.

#### 0.33.1.1

* Declare correct error return type for derived multi handlers. These
  were declared as `Reason (Reason e)`, now they are `Reason ()`. This
  generated confusing documentation.

### 0.33.1

* Move `Range` from `Rest.Handler` into `rest-types`. Still re-exported.

## 0.33

* Added a `Rest.Types.Error.ToResponseCode` constraint to `jsonE`, `xmlE`, and `xmlJsonE`.
* Changed `domainReason` to have a `ToResponseCode` constraint instead of an explicit argument.
* Added `Rest.ShowUrl` re-exporting `ShowUrl` from `rest-types`.
* `application/*` and `application/octet-stream` accept headers now match file outputs.

#### 0.32.0.2
* Allow random 1.1.*

#### 0.32.0.1
* Fix bug in Chrome when serving files with commas in name.

## 0.32

* Add `addHeader` dictionary combinator, to extend instead of replace
  the header dictionaries. For this, a constructor `TwoHeaders` was
  added to `Header`.
* Relax the types of `mkListing` and `mkOrderedListing` to allow
  parameters and headers.

### 0.31.1

* Expose `Rest.Driver.Routing.splitUriString`.
* Make test cases compile again.

## 0.31

* Schema: `action` has been renamed to `static` since it is tied to `statics` and to disambiguate it from the unrelated `actions`.

#### 0.30.0.3

* Use `json-schema 0.5.*`

#### 0.30.0.2

* Use `rest-stringmap == 0.2.*`

#### 0.30.0.1

* Allow `mtl == 2.2.*` and `transformers == 0.4.*`

## 0.30

* Use `Content-Disposition` to provide filenames for file responses.
  This slightly changes the semantics of `FileO`: what used to be
  interpreted as the file extension is now used for the whole file name.

* `Rest.Types.Container.StringMap` Has been replaced by `rest-stringmap`. This
  changes the XML serialization format of multi part messages, the old format
  was `<map><key>k</key>v[...]</map>` and the new one is
  `<map><value key="k">v</value>[...]</map>`.

## 0.29

* Add multi-delete handler. It is used on a DELETE to
  `/<resource>/<id>/` and is derived from the single delete handler.
* Don't put `Cache-Control: private` header on served files. This way
  they can be cached by public proxies, e.g. cloudfront.
* Add `Show` instances for `Header`, `Param` and `Dict`.
* Renamed `mkMultiPutHandler` to `mkMultiHandler` in
  `Rest.Driver.Routing`.
* Explicit exports in `Rest.Driver.Routing`, removing a lot of
  private functions from the public interface.
